# House Price Predictor - Frontend

## Overview

The **House Price Predictor** is a web-based application designed to estimate house prices based on various input parameters. This is the frontend part of the project, which provides a user-friendly interface to input data and display the predicted house prices. The backend logic for predicting prices should be connected via an API.

## Features

- **Responsive Design:** Works well on all screen sizes.
- **Dynamic Input Form:** Allows users to input various house-related parameters (e.g., size, location, number of bedrooms).
- **API Integration:** Communicates with a backend server to fetch predictions.
- **Clean and Minimal UI:** Designed with simplicity in mind for a seamless user experience.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML:** For creating the structure of the web pages.
- **CSS:** For styling the application and ensuring responsiveness.
- **JavaScript:** For handling user interactions, form validation, and API calls.

## Prerequisites

To run the frontend, ensure that you have a working backend API that provides house price predictions. The API should accept the necessary input parameters (e.g., location, square footage, number of bedrooms) and return the predicted price in JSON format.
